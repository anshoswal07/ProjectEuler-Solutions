#Function to calculate sum of squares, taking in parameter num
def sum_of_squares(num):
    #Sum of squares, i.e, summation(n^2) is a known value given by the formula below
    val = (1/6) * (num) * (num + 1) * (2 * num + 1)
    return val

#Function to calcuate the square of the sum, taking in parameter num
def square_of_sum(num):
    #First calculating sum of natural numbers till n
    val = (1/2) * (num) * (num + 1)
    #Then squaring the value
    val = val ** 2
    return val

#Function to return difference of values taking in parameter x
def difference(x):
    diff = square_of_sum(x) - sum_of_squares(x)
    return diff
    
#Returning value of difference with given test set of '100'
